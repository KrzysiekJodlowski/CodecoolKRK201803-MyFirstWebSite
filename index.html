                <img src="img/about_me.jpg" alt="Picture of me">
                <p id="imageParagraph">Born in Cracow, he's been living here 
                    ever since. By education a naturalist, from the nature a 
                    phlegmatic who likes to walk in the mountains, ride a bike, 
                    work in wood and play board games.<br /><br />The most he doesnâ€™t like 
                    a lack of understanding derived from lack of communication, 
                    and loves when the task is well done. Sometimes he's a loner, 
                    sometimes just the opposite. Likes to considering problems 
                    while walking with his dog and hates being late.<br /><br />He prefers 
                    getting to the point instead of distracting himself with side 
                    topics. If he has time, he likes to think carefully about 
                    decisions he's going to make.</p>
