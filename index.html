                <img src="img/about_me.jpg" alt="Picture of me">
                <p>Born in Cracow, he's been living here ever since. 
                    By education a naturalist, from the nature a phlegmatic 
                    who likes to walk in the mountains, ride a bike, work 
                    in wood and play board games. The most he doesnâ€™t like 
                    a lack of understanding derived from lack of communication, 
                    and loves when the task is well done. Sometimes he's a loner, 
                    sometimes just the opposite. Likes to considering problems 
                    while walking with his dog and hates being late. He prefers 
                    getting to the point instead of distracting himself with side 
                    topics. If he has time, he likes to think carefully about 
                    decisions he's going to make.</p>
